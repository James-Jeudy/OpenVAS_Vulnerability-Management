# OpenVAS Vulnerability Management
## Project: OpenVAS Vulnerability Management on Vulnerable Windows VM in Azure. 

## Introduction
In this project, I used Microsoft Azure to setup and configure OpenVas as my vulnerability scanner to get some experience in vulnerability management. In my environment, I setup OpenVAS as my vulnerability scanner on a Linux VM and used a Windows 10 Virtual Machine as the PC to be scanned. On the Windows 10 VM, some outdated software was installed and the firewall was temporarily turned off. The old software included an old version of Adobe Reader, VLC Player, & Mozilla Firefox. Two different scans were ran on the Windows 10 machine. One was an uncredentialed scan and the other was a credentialed scan.
